# Crossing Inspection App  
Designed with the users, developed with agile, user-tested, open-source, Esri JS API app

## Background    
Every year, VTrans Rail performs an inspection of all of it's railroad crossings. Afterwards, our inspector writes a 60+ page PDF report that is used by management to plan the budget, and is (usually) presented to the Transportation committees in the Legislature.  

The data and photos all reside in the GIS database, and some web maps are published. However, getting access to detailed information is cumbersome. Basic ArcGIS Online web maps lack functionality, and ArcMap overwhelms you with functionality.

**A "Goldilocks" solution was needed**

### Our Design Studio
We ran a 4-hour design studio with 9 participants and two moderators.
Participants included:  
- Engineers
- Project managers
- Property managers  
- Planners  
- Public relations  
- Environmental specialists (_external_)  
- ROW specialist (_external_)  

We gave an overview of the process and then split into three rooms. Each room was assigned a **Persona**, and associated **User Stories**.

### Personas:  
3. Legislature/Public  
1. Rail Engineers  
2. Management  

### User Stories

_Executive_
