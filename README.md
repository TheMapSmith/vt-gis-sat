# Agile Design Studio  
A combination of `Agile` methodologies, and interactive, iterative, user-driven design.

**Agile**
http://vtrans.github.io/vtp3-roadmap/agile.html  
- Iterative, incremental, evolutionary approach  
- Efficient: use face-to-face communications  
- Take advantage of short feedback loop  
- Focus on quality  
- Personas  
- User Stories  

**Design Studio**  
- Use small, cross-functional teams  
- Generate a ton of design concepts in a small amount of time.  
- "15 highly paid team members spent an entire day. Generated two weeks worth of work (420 design concepts, 380 uniques) for one scenario in less than six hours."  
- Get instant buy-in from management, developers.  
- More accurate development estimates  
- Vet design concepts before wasting development cycles on them  
- Only Tools needed:  
*Butcher paper, sharpies, stopwatch*  

### Create - Pitch - Critique
#### 6 - 8 - 5
**Create**  
- Each person creates 6 to 8 **ROUGH** concept sketches  
- Fat sharpie in a small area - just capture the idea (you'll explain them later)    
- Break down the fear of drawing: a sloppy rectangle can be a search box or label or... it doesn't matter because you'll get to explain it later.  
- Everyone is on the same page (literally) - everyone is equally uncomfortable with drawing  

  **Pitch**  
  - 3 minutes to pitch your idea to your team  
  - Tell: what scenario did you design for, goals you tried to achieve, how did design address those goals  
  - No questions from group - wait and listen (and take notes of questions)  

**Critique**  
- 2 minutes to give critiques  
- _Not Feedabck!_ ("I like/don't like <blank>")  
- 2-3 ways it solves the problem  
- 1-2 opportunities to improve  

### Iterate based on critiques  

### Repeat, but as a team  
**Create**  
- Take the "best-of" elements from team members  
- Coalesce into a comprehensive design  

**Pitch**  
- 3 minutes to pitch your team's idea to the other team  

**Critique**  
- Other teams critique your team's design  

## Each "Create" step only lasts 5 minutes  

## Post-processing:
- Take the sketches back and begin grouping and filtering  
- Take inspiration from the sketches and develop prototypes
- Run a small version of the process internally to reach the final outcome.
