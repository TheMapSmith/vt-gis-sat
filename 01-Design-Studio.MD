# Agile Design Studio  
A combination of **Agile** methodologies, and interactive, iterative, **user-driven design**.

### Agile  
[My Agile Description](http://vtrans.github.io/vtp3-roadmap/agile.html)  

- Iterative, incremental, evolutionary approach  
- Efficient: use face-to-face communications  
- Take advantage of short feedback loop  
- Focus on quality  
- Personas  
- User Stories  

### Design Studio

_What it is_  

"Not a place or a tool; a time boxed, collaborative design session that serves to consolidate ideas and team direction around a common design"  

- Use small, cross-functional teams  
- Generate a ton of design concepts in a small amount of time.  
- "15 highly paid team members spent an entire day. Generated two weeks worth of work (420 design concepts, 380 uniques) for one scenario in less than six hours."  
- Get instant buy-in from management, developers.  
- More accurate development estimates  
- Vet design concepts before wasting development cycles on them  
- Only Tools needed: *Butcher paper, sharpies, stopwatch*  

_How it works_  

#### Create - Pitch - Critique

**Create**  
- Each person creates 6 to 8 **ROUGH** [concept sketches](img/erik-2.jpg)  
- Fat sharpie in a small area - just capture the idea _(you'll explain them later)_    
- Break down the fear of drawing
  - A sloppy rectangle can be a search box or label or... it doesn't matter because you'll get to explain it later.  
  - Everyone is on the same page (literally) - everyone is equally uncomfortable with drawing  
- Break down the fear of creativity: do a simple exercise as an example  
  - "As a meeting planner, I need to seat 12 people in a room."
  - Have the group brainstorm 6-8 ways this could happen  

**Pitch**  
- 3 minutes to pitch your idea to your team  
- Tell:
  - What scenario you designed for  
  - Goals you tried to achieve  
  - How did design address those goals  
- No questions from group - wait and listen _(and take notes for the next step)_  

**Critique**  
- 2 minutes to give critiques  
- _**Not Feedabck!**_ ("I like/don't like <blank>")  
- 2-3 ways it solves the problem  
- 1-2 opportunities to improve  

### Iterate based on critiques  

### Repeat, but as a team  
**Create**  
- Take the "best-of" elements from team members  
- Coalesce into a [comprehensive design](/img/exec.jpg)  

**Pitch**  
- 3 minutes to pitch your team's idea to the other team  

**Critique**  
- Other teams critique your team's design  

_When introducing this activity, save this detail for last:_  
## Each "Create" step only lasts 5 minutes  

## Post-processing:
- Take the sketches back and begin grouping and filtering  
- Take inspiration from the sketches and develop prototypes
- Run a small version of the process internally to reach the final outcome.
